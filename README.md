Undergraduate  network security research with Dr. Wellman


The objective of this research is to design and develop autonomous network mapping software agents capable of conducting a mapping of an enterprise computer network environment. These agents will utilize reinforcement learning algorithms to support the automation of the computer network mapping functionality. This research explores several research ideas to achieve these goals. It will address the reality of the network environments that drive our modern society and provide real-time vigilance of everything to stay ahead of threats.
